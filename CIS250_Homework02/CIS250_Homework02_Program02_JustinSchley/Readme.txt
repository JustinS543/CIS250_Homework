//==================================================

The program allows a user to enter in the radius of a circle and receive:

1. The area of the circle
2. The diameter of the circle
3. The circumference of the circle

Upon executing the program, the user will be prompted to enter in the radius.
Once entered, the program will calculate the above mentioned results and display
them to the user.

The program utilizes a Circle class to host the data, along with the necessary
calculations. To set the radius of the Circle object, pass a double to setRadius().
For displaying the results, the object uses:

1. getArea()
2. getDiameter()
3. getCircumference()

All of these are called by the results() function.
