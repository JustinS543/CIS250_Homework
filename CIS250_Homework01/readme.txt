The program, Employee Structured Data, provides many functions:

1. Displays all employees and their information
2. Displays the name of the oldest employee
3. Displays the building letter and floor of the Computer Science department
4. Displays all departments in building A
5. Allows searching for an employee by SSN
6. Displays the average age of employees in Michigan

When the program is started, the user is prompted to make a selection based on the menu provided.
For options 1-4 & 6, the information is displayed and an option to either return to the previous menu or exit is displayed.
For option 5, the user is prompted to enter in a social security number (with or without dashes) to search for an employee.
If an employee is not found, an error will appear for the user.

With the exception of option 5, before entering in a social security number, the user can enter 99 to return to the previous
menu, or enter -999 to end the program.

The employee list is stored in ~\CIS250_Homework01_JustinSchley\CIS250_Homework01_JustinSchley.
